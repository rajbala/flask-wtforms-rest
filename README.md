I couldn't find a complete minimal example of a Flask app that uses WTForms that *consumes* a REST API.  There are plenty of examples and extensions where the Flask app *is* the REST API, but seemingly no examples of how to use Flask in front of a REST API. 

You'll need to supply a REST endpoint on the backend.
